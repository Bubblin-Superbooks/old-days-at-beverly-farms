I found in this old house a garret, a beautiful garret, where bundles of herbs hung from the rafters, and where books, books galore had collected in old sea chests. Fancy my delight, at finding, one red letter day, Christopher North’s, “Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life.”</p><p>There were other books not so well fitted for the education of a child, but it was all fish that came to my net, and I calmly read up to my tenth year, “The Criminal Calendar,” “Tales of Shipwrecks,” Barber’s “Historical Massachusetts,” Paley’s “Moral Philosophy,” Pollock’s “Course of Time,” Alleine’s “Alarm to the Unconverted,” Richardson’s “Pamela” and the “Spectator!” Some years afterwards, when I had read the covers off this miscellaneous collection of books, some of the earlier summer people, the elder Lorings and Kings, I think, put a small library into Uncle Pride’s house and gave us Jacob Abbott’s Rollo Stories and a few other delights.
