Then Uncle Jimmy kept watch and on a beautiful moonlight night he had the satisfaction of beholding a long line of rodents with an old gray fellow as leader, crossing the road on their way to Uncle David’s. (I tell the story as it was told to me). Uncle Jimmy’s daughter, Mary, married Dr. Wyatt C. Boyden, for many years the skilful family physician of half the town. The fine public spirited Boydens of Beverly are her descendants.</p><p>By the way, the old vernacular of the village ought not to perish from the earth. It was unique. Our ancestors just hated to pronounce any word correctly, even when they were fairly good scholars and spellers. They called a marsh a “mash.” Capt. Timothy Marshall, the rich man of the place, was called Capt. “Mashall”; Mr. Osborne was Mr. “Osman”; the Obers were “Overs”, a lilac was a “laylock” a blue jay was a blue “gee,” etc.</p></div> </div>
