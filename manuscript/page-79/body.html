As to ice, I am scared to death of it, nothing else ever keeps me in the house.</p><p>My old assistant at school, declares that one winter she dragged me up and down Everett St., every school day! Nothing like the quietness of this winter at Beverly Farms was ever seen. I think I must suggest to the Beacon St. people to come down. We have had a good many dark days, but now and then, I lie in my bed and watch the sun come up and glorify the oaks on your hill.</p><p>And then I quote to “Jim” Emerson’s lines:</p><p>“Oh! tenderly the haughty day</p><p>Fills his blue urn with fire.”</p><p>And he likes that about as well as he likes the stars in the middle of the night!</p><p>By the way, we are thinking of going to Colorado and Florida next month for a few weeks. We have got the bits in our teeth, though we may have to go to the City Home when we get back. We mean to try the month of March in warmer climes. We haven’t anything to wear—but that does not matter.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
