Loring.</p><p>Mrs. William Caleb Loring bought Mrs. Dow’s house after her death and gave it to St. John’s Parish for a parish house. She directed that a tablet should be placed in it to preserve the memory of our friend.</p><p>In examining the titles Mr. Samuel Vaughan found that Mrs. Dow’s great grandfather, Jonathan Larcom, did not sell his slaves. He was administrator of his father, David Larcom’s estate in 1775. In the appraisal, six slaves are mentioned by name, valued at £106 13s. 4d. but none are mentioned in the division. It appears that they became free when their master died. All slaves were considered free in Massachusetts when the State Constitution was adopted in 1780.</p><p>Katharine P.
