<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">crowds of children accompanied by their fathers and mothers and uncles and aunts and cousins, all pouring into the “movies!” (One of these movies named for Lucy Larcom!) One must go on, and now we are trying to hope that some good may come out of the “movies!” If our little religious library was the “Third Social” there must have been two more in old Beverly.</p><p>I want you to go back in your mind to a Sunday of that time when even a walk to the woods or to the beach was wicked, when the only books that were proper to read were religious books, when there were three religious services every Sunday and pretty awfully long services. My cousin and my sister and I crawled up a long ladder to the third floor of our barn, among the pigeons’ nests, and, nestling down in the hay, produced a <em>novel</em>, a real novel, a wishy washy thing, that no money could hire me to read today, and with quiet whisperings read that <em>wicked</em> book. We were in mortal terror lest “Aunt Phebe” should suspect our deep degradation, and “Aunt Phebe” was not a foe either. She was a beautiful, big, kindly woman, as Mrs. Crowell, her step-daughter, would gladly attest.</p></div> </div>
