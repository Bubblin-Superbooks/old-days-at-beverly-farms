I remember my disgust at finding that I was related thro’ my maternal grandmother, Molly Standley, to “Aunt Massy.” Aunt Massy, (her real name was Mercy) was a mildly insane, gray-haired, stoutish woman, who lived just before you reach the fountain at the top of the hill, on Hale St. There was a well with a windlass and bucket at one side of her old house and Aunt Massy used to lean on the well curb and abuse the passers by. She remembered all the mean things one’s relatives ever did, and how she could scold! I was often sent to Mr. Perry’s grocery store where Pump Cottage now stands and I used to try to get by without hearing her uplifted voice. But if I had a new gown there was no escape.</p><p>The two districts I have mentioned, (East and West Farms) were divided by “Saw Mill Brook,” the little half choked stream that now filters under the road between Mr. Hardy’s and Mr. Simpkins’ places. It was a beautiful brook in those old days, clear water running through fields, with trout in it. The saw mill must have stood about where that collection of tenement houses now is.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
