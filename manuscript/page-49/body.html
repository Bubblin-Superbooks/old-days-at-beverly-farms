I never heard these shrieks, I took good care never to be caught over there after dark. I should have liked to see the little screech owl, who, no doubt, had his quiet home up back of the mill, and sang his evening song, after the miller had closed his gates. We villagers have a question to propose to all our friends of uncertain age,—“Do you remember the saw-mill?” If, inadvertently, they confess to its acquaintance, it settles the question of age. It is as good as a Family Bible.</p><p>Miss Culbert showed me the other day, a great find, the remnant of the “Third Social Library of Beverly.” I had never heard of such a library and was greatly interested. It is now in our beautiful branch library, in a neat book case made by one of the Obers, in whose house the Library was placed. I mean the old Joseph Ober house which stood where Mrs. Charles M. Cabot’s house is.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "></p></div> </div>
